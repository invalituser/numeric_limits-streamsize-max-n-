# numeric_limits-streamsize-max-n-
# Here i explained "numeric_limits&lt<streamsize>::max(), '\n'"
1. numeric_limits is the thing that says to pc to check the size of some data type. so it means istead of <streamsize> we can have <int> , <double>, <string> and so on...
2. Now streamsize is like: size of stream, it is also data type as i know. But i could not understand what kind of data type is it exactly but it is used to take any value from cout, cin.
3. So, the next is ::max this says to take maximum value of <streamsize>.
4. The next thing is '\n' , this means it qill ignore until cin.ignore() reach newline.
